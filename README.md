## This is a reversible multi-user watermarking scheme based on quantization index modulation (QIM).

### 1. Reversibility
We utilized a reversible version of QIM, which is described in [A Lattice-Based Embedding Method for Reversible Audio Watermarking](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10247563).

### 2. Multibility
Decompose the signal vector into several orthogonal vectors and embed messages separately.

### 3. About the code
Only simple functions are provided here, and different carriers and messages need to be processed accordingly.
